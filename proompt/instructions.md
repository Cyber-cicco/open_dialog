We need to create the choice node component, and add the function in the context to create it.

A choice node is composed of choices. On creation, it has to have a default choice.

Every choice, on it's right edge, has a source handle. 

Every choice has a content, which can be long so only show the beginning and truncate the text. You can also create another condition on the phylum.

We won't implement the modal or the condition editor yet, we'll only implement the choice node with the architecture necessary to add and edit the choices later.
